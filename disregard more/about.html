            We actually need decent stuff here
            <!--Add this in before the contest lol-->
            <!--(we're looking at you guys!)-->? You've come to the right place. Here, we will introduce necessary topics to know, such as basic programming, cryptography, working with binaries, and more.</p>
        <p class="a-ctctf">
            We also highly recommend other sources for training, such as the USACO training pages LINK, Project Euler LINK, and Codeforces LINK. Those are all great algorithmic training sources, but if you want a more general experience, visit the site of a previous CTF and take a look at the problems and their training material. Some examples are picoCTF LINK, easyCTF LINK, CSAW CTF LINK, HSCTF LINK, and others.</p>
