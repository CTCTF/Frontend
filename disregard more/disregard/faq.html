                    <h1 class="question">What's a CTF?</h1>
                    <h2 class="answer">In a CTF (Capture the Flag) competition, teams attempt to capture flags. Flags, or short strings, are disguised in some fashion. For example, they might be encrypted, hidden away on the internet, or built using an algorithm. Teams earn points for discovering (and submitting) these flags.</h2>

                    <h1 class="question">What's Capture the CTF?</h1>
                    <h2 class="answer">Inspired by <a href="http://picoctf.com">picoCTF</a>, <a href="http://easyctf.com">easyCTF</a>, and <a href="http://hsctf.com">HSCTF</a>, Capture the CTF is a CTF for High School students (and below) created by High School students. The goal is not only to be an educational resource, but also to expose students to the exciting world of computer security. For example, this CTF will include problems topics such as cryptography, reverse-engineering, web exploitation, and more!</h2>

                    <h1 class="question">Who is the competition for?</h1>
                    <h2 class="answer">CTCTF will be open to students in high school or below. Teams will be composed of up to <i>four</i> students. Because of the length of the competition, teams consisting of fewer students are not necessarily put at a significant disadvantage. Official teams must consist of students who attend the same school, although exceptions will be made on a case-by-case basis. Teams who do not meet the above criteria are welcome to participate non-competitively. </h2>

                    <h1 class="question">Why compete?</h1>
                    <h2 class="answer">Capture the CTF will teach participants not just about computer security, but also about other areas such as the design of algorithms. And, most importantly, competing is a lot of fun!</h2>

                    <h2 class="answer">CTCTF will take place almost entirely on this website, although some challenges will require participants to explore the rest of the internet. Registration will be open shortly, and teams will use their login credentials to view all the problems when the competition starts.</h2>

                    <h2 class="answer">There will be a variety of challenges, each of which will be worth a number of points determined by its difficulty. Once your team discovers a flag, its submission to our judging server will earn points towards your team's overall score.</h2>

                    <h2 class="answer">CTCTF requires participants to utilize common sense with regard to fairness. Specifically, attacking CTCTF's infrastructure, including the website, scoring server, and other teams, constitutes cheating. Sharing flags, providing or soliciting hints, and soliciting direct assistance from people other than your teammates also constitutes cheating. Using printed or online resources during the competition is allowed, provided no "live help" is occurring.</h2>
