                    <h1 class="question">What's a CTF?</h1>
                    <h2 class="answer">In a CTF (Capture the Flag) competition, teams attempt to capture flags. Flags, or short strings, are disguised in some fashion. For example, they might be encrypted, hidden away on the internet, or built using an algorithm. Teams earn points for discovering (and submitting) these flags.</h2>

                    <h1 class="question">What's Capture the CTF?</h1>
                    <h2 class="answer">Inspired by <a href="http://picoctf.com">picoCTF</a>, <a href="http://easyctf.com">easyCTF</a>, and <a href="http://hsctf.com">HSCTF</a>, Capture the CTF is a CTF for High School students (and below) created by High School students. The goal is not only to be an educational resource, but also to expose students to the exciting world of computer security. For example, this CTF will include problems topics such as cryptography, reverse-engineering, web exploitation, and more!</h2>

                    <h1 class="question">Who is the competition for?</h1>
                    <h2 class="answer">CTCTF will be open to students in high school or below. Teams will be composed of up to <i>four</i> students. Because of the length of the competition, teams consisting of fewer students are not necessarily put at a significant disadvantage. Official teams must consist of students who attend the same school, although exceptions will be made on a case-by-case basis. Teams who do not meet the above criteria are welcome to participate non-competitively. </h2>
