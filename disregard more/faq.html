        <div class="question">
            <p class="question-q">What's a CTF?</p>
            <p class="question-a">In a CTF (Capture the Flag) competition, teams attempt to, well, capture flags. Flags, or short strings, are disguised in some fashion. For example, they might be encrypted, hidden away on the internet, or built using an algorithm. Teams earn points for discovering (and submitting) these flags.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p class="question-q">Ok, what's Capture the CTF?</p>
            <p class="question-a">We are following up on the success of picoCTF
                <insert link>, easyCTF
                    <insert link>, and HSCTF
                        <insert link>, the latter of which provided the inspiration for CTCTF's creation. Like HSCTF, this CTF is for students, by students. We aim not only to be an educational resource, but also to expose students to the exciting world of computer science. To this end, we include problems not just from the usual CTF canon, which consists mostly of computer security tasks, but also from other areas of computer science. For example, we will include problems involving the design and implementation of algorithms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p class="question-q">Who is the competition for?</p>
            <p class="question-a">This competition will be open to students in high school or below. Teams will be composed of up to four students - and we really do mean "<i>up to</i> four"! Because of the length of the competition, teams consisting of fewer students are not necessarily put at a significant disadvantage, and we welcome their participation. Official teams must consist of students who attend a single school, though exceptions will be made on a case-by-case basis for students, especially homeschooled ones, who are affiliated with a certain school. Teams who do not meet the above criteria are welcome to participate non-competitively.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p class="question-q">Why compete?</p>
            <p class="question-a">We found, by participating in picoCTF and HSCTF, that our own computer science skills advanced rapidly as a direct result of participation. CTCTF will teach participants not just about computer security, but also about other areas such as the design of algorithms. And, most importantly, competing is a lot of fun!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p class="question-q">How difficult is it?</p>
            <p class="question-a">There will be challenges tailored to students of all levels, whether you're a seasoned veteran or still struggling with the "Hello World!" program. Some problems will be solved by nearly every team, while some will be solved by none at all. It will be possible to do very well without any prior CTF experience, though having programming experience will be very useful. Everyone should find it a rewarding experience!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p class="question-q">How do we compete?</p>
            <p class="question-a">CTCTF will take place almost entirely on this website, though some challenges will require participants to explore the rest of the internet. Registration will be open shortly, and teams will use their login credentials to view all the problems when the competition starts.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p class="question-q">What do I need to compete?</p>
            <p class="question-a">Participation requires only a computer, internet access, and the ability to download applications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p class="question-q">What is the competition format?</p>
            <p class="question-a">
                There will be a variety of challenges, each of which will be worth a number of points determined by its difficulty. Once your team discovers a flag, its submission to our judging server will earn points towards your team's overall score.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p class="question-q">What if I win?</p>
            <p class="question-a">
                We will award the following prizes to the top teams:
                <!---<jay do this>-->
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p class="question-q">Is "X" allowed?</p>
            <p class="question-a">
                CTCTF requires participants to utilize common sense with regard to fairness. Specifically, attacking CTCTF's infrastructure, including the website, scoring server, and other teams, constitutes cheating. Sharing flags, providing or soliciting hints, and soliciting direct assistance from people other than your teammates also constitutes cheating. Using printed or online resources during the competition is allowed, provided no "live help" is occurring.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <p class="question-q">Who wrote CTCTF?</p>
            <p class="question-a">
                CTCTF is written by students affiliated with the Bergen County Academies in New Jersey. The founders, and operators, consist of Alexander Katz (12th grade), David Yang (11th grade), and Jay Mo (9th grade).</p>

        <div class="question">
            <p class="question-q">How do I practice?</p>
            <p class="question-a">
                picoCTF
                <insert link>, HSCTF
                    <insert link>are both CTF competitions geared towards high school students, and the qualification round of CSAW CTF
                        <insert link>is accessible to students. For the algorithmic problems, USACO
                            <insert link>and Codeforces
                                <insert link>are both high-quality sources of practice problems. Prepare for problems in many fields of "CTF"ing.
